# Summer event bookings are now open across the Portland metro area

![Summer events](/blog/images/summer-bookings-open/cover.jpg)

> With warmer months approaching, EventGear is officially opening priority booking for summer events throughout Portland, Oregon and nearby Vancouver, Washington. Presentations, company events, and association meetings are already appearing on the calendar.

Our team has prepared weather aware AV packages that perform reliably in outdoor and mixed environments. From portable sound systems to high brightness displays, we help organizers maintain professional production quality even outside traditional venues.

Summer dates tend to fill quickly, especially for weekends and multi day programs. We encourage planners to reach out early so we can reserve the right equipment and coordinate logistics. EventGear looks forward to supporting another active season of events across the region.
