# EventGear adds new wireless microphone kits to the rental fleet

![Wireless microphones](/blog/images/new-wireless-microphone-kits/cover.jpg)

> Clear audio remains one of the most critical elements of any successful presentation. In response to client feedback, EventGear has added a new line of professional wireless microphone kits to our rental inventory in Portland and Vancouver.

The updated systems offer improved signal stability, longer battery life, and simplified frequency coordination for busy RF environments. They are well suited for corporate meetings, hotel ballrooms, and hybrid events where reliability is essential.

Our technicians have already deployed the new kits at several recent conferences in the Portland metro area with excellent results. Clients reported cleaner sound and easier presenter transitions. The new microphone packages are now available for all upcoming bookings, and our team is ready to recommend the best configuration for your event.
