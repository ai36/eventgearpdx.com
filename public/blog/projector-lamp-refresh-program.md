# EventGear completes annual projector lamp refresh

![Image](/blog/images/projector-lamp-refresh-program/cover.jpg)

To maintain consistent image quality across our rental fleet, EventGear has completed the annual projector lamp refresh program ahead of the winter conference season. This initiative focuses on brightness stability and color accuracy for high impact presentations.

Each unit in our Portland and Vancouver inventory underwent runtime analysis and optical inspection. Lamps approaching performance thresholds were proactively replaced, and systems were recalibrated under controlled test conditions.

For clients, this means more predictable screen brightness and fewer technical risks during critical presentations. Our technical services group will continue monitoring usage metrics throughout the season to ensure every deployed projector meets EventGear performance standards.
