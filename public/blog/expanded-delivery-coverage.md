# EventGear expands delivery coverage in the greater Portland region

![Delivery service](/blog/images/expanded-delivery-coverage/cover.jpg)

> To better support growing client demand, EventGear has expanded its delivery and pickup coverage throughout the greater Portland metropolitan area and Southwest Washington. The update allows for more flexible scheduling and faster response times for last minute requests.

Our logistics team has added new routing capacity and refined staging procedures to keep equipment moving efficiently between venues. This improvement is especially valuable for clients managing multi location programs or tight setup windows.

Reliable delivery remains a core part of the EventGear experience. Whether supporting a downtown Portland conference or a corporate meeting in Vancouver, Washington, our team is focused on keeping every event on schedule and fully equipped.
