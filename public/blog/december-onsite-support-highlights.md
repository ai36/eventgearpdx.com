# Strong demand for onsite technical support in December

![Onsite support](/blog/images/december-onsite-support-highlights/cover.jpg)

> December has brought a noticeable increase in requests for full onsite technical support throughout the Portland metro area. Many organizations are prioritizing live technician presence to ensure smooth execution of year end meetings and executive presentations

EventGear field teams have supported a wide range of venues, from downtown conference centers to corporate campuses in Vancouver, Washington. Recent deployments focused on fast presenter transitions, real time audio management, and coordinated show cues.

The trend reflects a broader shift toward higher production expectations, even for internal meetings. EventGear will continue expanding technician availability to match client needs as we move into the new year.
