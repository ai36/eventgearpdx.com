# Preparing for the year end event rush

![Image](/blog/images/holiday-event-rush-preparation/cover.jpg)

As the holiday season approaches, EventGear is entering one of the busiest periods of the year across Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. Corporate celebrations, nonprofit galas, and internal town halls are already filling the calendar for November and December.

Our operations team has completed a full preventive maintenance cycle on core inventory to ensure consistent performance during peak demand. Additional staging space has also been activated to support faster turnaround between back to back events.

Clients planning holiday programs are encouraged to confirm technical requirements early. Advance coordination allows our crew to recommend the right audio visual configuration and avoid last minute adjustments. EventGear is ready to support a smooth and professional finish to the 2025 event season.
